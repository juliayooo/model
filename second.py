# When training neural networks, the most frequently used algorithm
# is back propagation. In this algorithm, parameters (model
# weights)  are adjusted according to the loss function gradient
# with respect to the given parameter. The loss function calculates
# the difference between the expected output and the actual output
# that a neural network produces. The goal is to get the result of
# the loss function as close to zero as possible. The algorithm
# traverses backwards through the neural network to adjust the
# weights and bias to retrain the model. That's why it's called
# back propagation. This back and forward process of retraining
# the model over time to reduce the loss to 0 is called the
# gradient descent.
